<p>However, I wanted to have the latest posts appear on our site as well without any of us needing to update and redeploy the site each time a new article is published because we want to expose the content directly to our visitors who wouldn’t necessarily be inclined to visit the blog specifically.</p>

<p>As it turns out this is not so easy to do, unless you are a developer and know how to work with APIs.
Being a designer and a basic front-ender, I figured there has to be a way to do this with the almighty jQuery. After some googling I’ve stumbled upon several hints that made me think it might be possible, and it involves getting JSON-formatted content from Medium, and parsing it into your HTML with jQuery.</p>

            <div>The more computed our environment becomes, the further back it returns us to our primitive past, boomerangs us right back to an animistic world view where everything has a spirit, rocks and lions and men. So all the objects in the world become more responsive, things that were once regarded as dumb become addressable, and that universal addressability—a network of things—creates this enchanted landscape. Magic is literally in the air.</div>

            <div>The other way I’d put it is that “Fiorucci Made Me Hardcore”. You can have an over-investment in a brand, I don’t mean in an obsessive trainer-collector way, but as an excess of energy charged to a brand that has been unconsciously nominated as a totem which then allows a kinship to build around it. So that embrace you speak of is a passionate one, it’s intense and productive, not just consumptive. That’s what the 20th century saw happen in the development of subcultures.</div>

            <div>Commerce, similar to biology, is based on selection and competition where environment and attraction play a crucial role. Brands are real, singular entities with their own histories and capacities. Although extensions of ourselves, they have material bodies, they impact our imaginations and emotions. Commerce has become a huge ecological and geological force, and today the Internet is where it is culturally liquefied in images, in social and financial transactions. I really think it is time to drop or at least question such standard notions in critical theory like commodification, fetish and desire.</div>
